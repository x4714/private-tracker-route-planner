A fork of invite.icu turned into a TrackerPathways alternative due to lag issues, using AI-generated content.<br>
EDIT: This also laggs if you want to display too many jumps, but i added nice features.

features
- smooth on mobile
- smooth on desktop
- tracker route data from handokota/trackerpathways
- tracker tooltips that display data from HDVinnie/Private-Trackers-Spreadsheet
- tracker type based coloring
